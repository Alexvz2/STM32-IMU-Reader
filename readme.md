# STM32 IMU Serial Reader
This Code is for UBC Orbit, an engineering team witht he objective to build a fully automated cubesat.
This code was build specifically for obtaining measurements of the LSM9DS0 IMU from an STM32 Nucleo6401RE, using the arduino ide as the main
compiler of the STM32 through a plugin by "", in addition with the library "", which interfaces between the Arduino Pins and the STM32 pins.
This Code is Based off Adafruits code for the LSM9DS0.
Feel free to contribute and use it for any purpose.
